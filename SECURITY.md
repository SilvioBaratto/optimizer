2. **Email**: silvio.baratto22@gmail.com

### What to include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix and disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter, typically within 30 days

## Scope

This policy applies to the `optimizer` Python package. The API server (`api/`) and CLI (`cli/`) have separate deployment considerations and should be evaluated in context.
